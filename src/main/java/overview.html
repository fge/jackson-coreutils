    <title>JSON core utilities for Jackson</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>What this is</h1>

<p>This package provides the following utilities over Jackson (2.2.x):</p>

<ul>
    <li>"single" JSON text read from sources;</li>
    <li>an {@code com.google.common.base.Equivalence} over {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode} for numeric JSON values;</li>
    <li>a generalized <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON
    pointer</a> implementation over Jackson's {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode};</li>
    <li>a JSON Pointer implementation for {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Single value reads</h1>

<p>By default, when you read an input source with Jackson using an {@link
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper}, the first JSON text is read and
the rest is ignored. For instance, with input:</p>

<pre>
    []]
</pre>

<p>the read will stop after the empty array has been read.</p>

<p>However, this may not be desirable. This package raises an error in this
case. The central class performing such reads is {@link
com.github.fge.jackson.JsonNodeReader}.</p>

<h1>JSON numeric equivalence</h1>

<p>Several IETF RFCs, or drafts, require that two JSON numeric values be
considered equal if their mathematical value is equal. Among these are JSON
Schema and JSON Patch. But this is not the case with {@link
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}: <span style="font-family: monospace">1
</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace">1.0</span> yield different
types of nodes.</p>

<p>This package provides an {@code com.google.common.base.Equivalence} to
ensure that two numeric nodes are considered equivalent if their mathematical
value is the same. See the javadoc for more information on how to use it.</p>

<h1>JSON Pointer</h1>

<p>JSON Pointer is an IETF draft which allows to unambiguously address a single
value in a JSON document. This package contains an implementation which can not
only address nodes in a {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}, but any
{@link com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode} implementation.</p>

<p>All JSON Pointer related classes are in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jackson.jsonpointer.JsonPointer}.</p>
